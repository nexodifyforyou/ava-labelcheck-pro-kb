Halal Rules (Pre-Audit Checklist)

Scope: Applies when the “Halal pre-audit” toggle is ON. Used to preflight labels, ingredient lists, and supporting documentation. This is a pre-audit tool, not a religious ruling. Treat client/buyer halal policies as authoritative where provided.

Core requirements

Prohibited sources: No pork/porcine derivatives, carrion, blood, intoxicants/alcohol (khamr), or carnivorous/raptor animals and their derivatives. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)

Animal-derived inputs: Gelatin, collagen, emulsifiers (E471/E472), glycerin, enzymes, rennet, and similar must come from halal-slaughtered sources with valid proof (halal certificate, CoC/CoA). (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)

Slaughter & sourcing: Where animal origin is involved, require halal slaughter according to recognized standards and certificates covering the raw material lots. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)

Alcohol/ethanol use: No alcohol as an ingredient. For solvents/carry-over, any ethanol must be technically unavoidable, non-intoxicating, and compliant with the certifying body’s standard; require supplier declaration. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1; HQC Guidance)

Flavourings & solvents: Verify bases and carriers (ethanol, propylene glycol, triacetin, etc.) and clouding agents are halal-compliant; obtain halal attestations. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)

Enzymes & cultures: Prefer microbial/plant sources. If animal-derived, must be halal-slaughtered with traceable documentation. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)

Processing aids & additives: All processing aids, additives, and carriers must be halal. Any ambiguous E-numbers must be treated as high-severity issues until proven halal. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)

Cross-contamination: Prevent contact with non-halal at all stages (receiving, storage, processing, transport). Require segregation, validated cleaning, and documented scheduling. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1; HAS 23000)

Certification mark: If claiming “Halal,” the label must show a valid halal logo and the issuing body. Certificate must cover the exact product/SKU and be current. (Codex CXG 24; Cert-body policy)

Traceability & documentation: Maintain a halal materials list (HML), supplier approvals, halal certificates, change-control, and production records sufficient for audit. (HAS 23000; OIC/SMIIC 1)

Transport & storage: Halal goods must be segregated, clearly identified, and packaged with halal-compliant materials. Prevent exposure to non-halal substances. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)

Claims discipline: Do not make halal claims, logos, or wording beyond certificate scope; ensure consistency across languages and pack versions. (Codex CXG 24)

High-risk E-numbers (always mark issue/high unless halal certificate provided)

If any of the following appear on a label, TDS, or ingredient list, mark issue, severity = high, and add comment:
“Requires halal verification from supplier (certificate/attestation needed).”

E120 – Cochineal / carmine (insect-derived)

E441 – Gelatin (animal-derived)

E471 / E472 – Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (may be from pork)

E422 – Glycerol (check origin: plant vs animal)

E920 – L-cysteine (hair/feather origin unless microbial)

E904 – Shellac (insect-derived)

E913 – Lanolin (sheep wool, check processing)

E1518 – Triacetin (must verify source)

E153 – Carbon black (processing aids vary)

Other ambiguous E-numbers: any solvent, emulsifier, or carrier not clearly plant/microbial must be verified.

⚠️ Rule: These must always be flagged until halal origin is documented.

Label-facing checks (artwork-level)

Halal logo & issuer: If halal is claimed, the logo must be visible and accompanied by the issuer’s name (e.g., “Certified by ___”). (Codex CXG 24)

Ingredients: No alcohol listed; no clearly prohibited components. (OIC/SMIIC 1)

Formatting: Ingredients and allergen formatting must still comply with EU1169 rules (bold allergens, QUID, etc.), separate from halal status.

Evidence expected (off-label)

Halal certificates for high-risk ingredients (gelatin, glycerin, emulsifiers, enzymes, flavourings).

Supplier statements on solvents/carriers and ethanol residues (% and justification).

Cleaning validation, segregation, and scheduling records for halal vs non-halal runs.

Examples for Fix Pack phrasing (illustrative)

Halal logo/issuer: “Add the halal certification mark and issuer: ‘Certified by ___ (valid to ___).’”

Animal-derived ingredient: “Replace gelatin with halal-certified bovine gelatin (certificate attached) or reformulate with plant pectin.”

High-risk E-number: “Provide halal certificate for E471 (mono- and diglycerides) to confirm halal origin.”

Flavour carrier: “Switch to non-alcohol carrier (e.g., triacetin/propylene glycol) or provide certificate showing compliant non-intoxicating carry-over.”

Segregation: “Document and implement production scheduling to run halal batches first after verified clean-down; attach records.”
