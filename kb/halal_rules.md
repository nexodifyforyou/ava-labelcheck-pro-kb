# Halal Rules (Pre-Audit Checklist)  
Scope: Applies when the “Halal pre-audit” toggle is ON. Used to preflight labels, ingredient lists, and supporting documentation. This is a **pre-audit tool**, not a religious ruling. Treat client/buyer halal policies as authoritative where provided.

## Core requirements
- **Prohibited sources**: No pork/porcine derivatives, carrion, blood, intoxicants/alcohol (khamr), or carnivorous/raptor animals and their derivatives. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)  
- **Animal-derived inputs**: Gelatin, collagen, emulsifiers (E471/E472), glycerin, enzymes, rennet must be from **halal-slaughtered sources** with valid proof.  
- **Slaughter & sourcing**: Require halal slaughter and certificates for all animal-origin inputs.  
- **Alcohol/ethanol use**: No alcohol as ingredient. Residual ethanol allowed only if technically unavoidable, non-intoxicating, and cert-body approved. Require declaration.  
- **Flavourings & solvents**: Verify flavour bases and carriers (ethanol, propylene glycol, triacetin, etc.); require halal attestations.  
- **Enzymes & cultures**: Prefer microbial/plant sources. If animal-derived, must be halal with traceable documentation.  
- **Processing aids & additives**: All additives and carriers must be halal. **Ambiguous E-numbers must always be flagged high** until certified halal.  
- **Cross-contamination**: Require segregation, validated cleaning, and scheduling.  
- **Certification mark**: If halal is claimed, show halal logo + issuer on label. Certificate must be valid and SKU-specific.  
- **Traceability & documentation**: Maintain halal material list, supplier approvals, halal certificates, and production records.  
- **Transport & storage**: Segregate halal goods and ensure halal-compliant packaging.  
- **Claims discipline**: Avoid misleading halal claims/logos beyond certificate scope.

## High-risk E-numbers (always mark issue/high unless certified halal)
If any of the following appear in label/TDS, mark **issue**, severity = **high**, with comment:  
“Requires halal verification from supplier (certificate/attestation needed).”  

- E120 – Cochineal/carmine (insect)  
- E441 – Gelatin (animal)  
- E471 / E472 – Mono-/diglycerides (possible pork fat)  
- E422 – Glycerol (check plant vs animal)  
- E920 – L-cysteine (hair/feather origin unless microbial)  
- E904 – Shellac (insect)  
- E913 – Lanolin (sheep wool)  
- E1518 – Triacetin (must verify origin)  
- E153 – Carbon black (processing aids vary)  
- Any other unclear E-number = flag high until proven halal

## Label-facing checks
- **Halal logo & issuer**: Must be visible and issuer named.  
- **Ingredients**: No alcohol; no obviously prohibited inputs.  
- **Formatting**: Allergen/ingredient formatting must still comply with EU1169.  

---

## Evidence expected
- Halal certs for high-risk ingredients (gelatin, emulsifiers, enzymes, flavourings).  
- Supplier declarations on solvents, carriers, ethanol residues.  
- Cleaning validation and segregation protocols.  

---

## Fix Pack phrasing examples
- **Halal logo/issuer**: “Add the halal certification mark and issuer: ‘Certified by ___ (valid to ___).’”  
- **Animal-derived ingredient**: “Replace gelatin with halal-certified bovine gelatin or plant pectin.”  
- **High-risk E-number**: “Provide halal certificate for E471 (mono- and diglycerides) to confirm halal origin.”  
- **Flavour carrier**: “Switch to non-alcohol carrier or provide certificate confirming halal compliance.”  
- **Segregation**: “Document scheduling to run halal batches first after clean-down; attach records.”
