# Halal Rules (Pre-Audit Checklist)
Scope: Applies when the “Halal pre-audit” toggle is ON. Used to preflight labels and ingredient lists; not a religious ruling. Treat client/buyer halal policies as authoritative where provided.

## Core requirements
- Prohibited sources: No pork/porcine derivatives, carrion, blood, intoxicants/alcohol (khamr), or carnivorous/raptor animals and their derivatives. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)
- Animal-derived inputs: Any animal ingredient (e.g., gelatin, collagen, emulsifiers E471/E472, mono-/diglycerides, glycerin, enzymes, rennet) must come from **halal-slaughtered** animals with documented proof (certificate, CoC/CoA). (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)
- Slaughter & sourcing: If animal origin is involved, require halal slaughter in line with recognized standards and valid certification covering the raw material lot(s). (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)
- Alcohol/ethanol use: Do **not** use alcohol as an ingredient. Any residual carry-over from processing aids or flavour carriers must be technically unavoidable, not intoxicating, and compliant with the relevant certification body’s policy; require supplier declaration. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1; HQC Guidance)
- Flavourings/solvents: Verify flavour bases and carriers (e.g., ethanol, propylene glycol), clouding agents, and extracts are halal-compliant; obtain composition statements and halal attestations. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)
- Enzymes & cultures: Microbial/plant enzymes preferred. If animal-derived, they must be from halal-slaughtered sources with traceable documentation. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)
- Processing aids & additives: All processing aids (defomers, filtering aids, lubricants), additives, and carriers must be halal; verify origin for ambiguous E-numbers. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)
- Cross-contamination: Prevent contact/mixing with non-halal at all stages (receiving, storage, processing, transport). Use documented segregation, validated cleaning, and scheduling. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1; HAS 23000)
- Certification mark on label: If claiming “Halal,” show a valid halal mark **and** the certification body/issuer; ensure the scope (product/SKU) and certificate are current. (Codex CXG 24; Cert-body policy)
- Traceability & documentation: Maintain a halal materials list (HML), approved supplier list, certificates, change-control, and production records sufficient for audit. (HAS 23000; OIC/SMIIC 1)
- Transport & storage: Segregate and identify halal goods; prevent exposure to non-halal substances and contaminants; ensure packaging is halal-compliant. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)
- Claims discipline: Avoid misleading halal claims, logos, or wording beyond certificate scope; ensure consistency across languages. (Codex CXG 24)

## Label-facing checks (what we look for on artwork)
- Halal logo present (if claimed) and readable; issuer named (e.g., “Certified by …”). (Codex CXG 24)
- No alcohol listed in ingredients; no obviously prohibited components on label. (OIC/SMIIC 1)
- Allergen & ingredients formatting stays consistent with EU rules (separate from halal status). (EU1169 baseline)

## Evidence we expect to collect (off-label)
- Supplier halal certificates for animal-derived materials, flavourings, enzymes, gelatin/glycerin/emulsifiers. (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1; HAS 23000)
- Statements on solvents/carriers and any ethanol residues (with % and technical justification). (OIC/SMIIC 1; GSO 2055-1)
- Cleaning validation, scheduling records, and segregation procedures. (HAS 23000)

## Examples for Fix Pack phrasing (illustrative)
- **Halal logo/issuer**: “Add the halal certification mark and issuer: ‘Certified by ___ (valid to ___).’”
- **Animal-derived ingredient**: “Replace gelatin with halal-certified bovine gelatin (certificate attached) or reformulate with plant pectin.”
- **Flavour carrier**: “Switch to non-alcohol carrier (e.g., triacetin/PG as permitted) or provide certificate showing compliant non-intoxicating carry-over.”
- **Segregation**: “Add statement of segregation in production records; schedule halal runs first post-verified clean-down.”
