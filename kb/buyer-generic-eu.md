# Buyer Generic Rules (EU baseline)

Scope: Prepacked foods placed on the EU market. Use as a practical preflight checklist. This is a preliminary assistant, not legal advice.

* **Legibility**: Mandatory particulars must be easily visible and legible with x-height ≥ **1.2 mm** (≥ **0.9 mm** for small packs) and adequate contrast. Keep sufficient whitespace. (EU1169: Art 13)
* **Language (market-acceptable)**: Mandatory particulars must appear in at least one **official language accepted by the country of sale** (e.g., BE: nl/fr/de; CH: de/fr/it). For multi-market packs, include all relevant languages. (EU1169: Art 15)
* **Sales name**: State the **legal name**; if none, use a **customary** or **accurate descriptive** name (not a brand). Avoid misleading terms. (EU1169: Art 17)
* **Ingredients list**: Provide when required; list in **descending order by weight** at time of use under a clear heading (e.g., “Ingredients/Ingredienti”). Include **compound ingredients** with their sub-ingredients. (EU1169: Art 18; Annex VII)
* **Allergen emphasis**: Emphasize **Annex II allergens within the ingredients list** (e.g., bold). Keep emphasis clear and consistent across occurrences. (EU1169: Art 21; Annex II)
* **QUID (ingredient %)**: If an ingredient/constituent is highlighted by **name, images, words, or implied by the sales name**, declare its **percentage (%)** near the sales name or, where permitted, in the ingredients list. (EU1169: Art 22; Annex VIII)
* **Net quantity**: Declare in legal units (solids: **g/kg**; liquids: **ml/L**). Keep prominent and in the required field of vision where applicable; “℮” symbol where used. (EU1169: Art 9(1)(e); Art 13(5))
* **Date marking**: Provide **“best before”/“best before end”** (durability) or **“use by”** (safety), as applicable. Keep wording spelled out and near any storage/use directions that determine it. (EU1169: Annex X)
* **Storage & conditions of use**: Include special storage conditions (e.g., “keep refrigerated”) and **conditions of use** where needed for safe/appropriate consumption or for the stated durability. (EU1169: Art 9(1)(g); Art 25)
* **FBO name & EU address**: Show the **food business operator’s** name and **EU postal address**; if the FBO is outside the EU, show the **EU importer’s** name and address. (EU1169: Art 8; Art 9(1)(h))
* **Nutrition declaration**: Provide the **mandatory nutrition information per 100 g/ml** in the prescribed **order, units, and format**; apply exemptions only where legally allowed. (EU1169: Arts 30–35; Annex XV; Annex V)
* **Country of origin / place of provenance**: Indicate when omission could **mislead**. If origin is given and the **primary ingredient** has a **different origin**, include the **primary ingredient origin disclosure**. (EU1169: Art 26; Commission Implementing Reg (EU) 2018/775)
* **Alcoholic beverages**: If **>1.2% vol**, state **actual alcoholic strength by volume (ABV)** as prescribed. (EU1169: Art 9(1)(k))
* **Claims discipline**: Any **nutrition/health claims** must be **authorized** and conditions met; avoid misleading statements, graphics, or overall presentation. (EU1169: Art 7; Reg (EC) 1924/2006; 432/2012)
* **Field of vision & grouping**: Where rules require certain particulars to appear **together** or in the **same field of vision** (e.g., some beverages/spirits), ensure correct grouping. (EU1169: Art 13; specific sector rules)
* **Presentation & hierarchy**: Keep mandatory info **unobstructed** by images/seals/promotional text; ensure a clear information hierarchy so mandatory items are easy to find. (EU1169: Art 13)
* **Multi-pack / multi-component**: Clarify what the **net quantity** and **nutrition declaration** refer to (per piece, drained weight, prepared state) and provide **per 100 g/ml** plus per portion where used. (EU1169: Annex XV; Annex IX for drained weight)
* **Images & illustrations**: If images suggest a **characterizing ingredient** (e.g., strawberries on front), **QUID** applies, and the **ingredient list** must reflect reality (no misleading imagery). (EU1169: Art 7; Art 22)
* **Label vs TDS consistency**: Ensure **label particulars** (name, ingredients, allergens, %QUID, nutrition, origin, claims) are **consistent with technical documentation** (TDS/specs); discrepancies must be corrected. (EU1169: Art 7; general due diligence)
* **Barcode area (best practice)**: Maintain a clear **quiet zone**, avoid seams/curves/heavy textures; test scanability at print scale. (Buyer rule)

**Buyer diligence & missing data protocol**

* If a mandatory detail **cannot be verified** (e.g., allergen emphasis from a flattened PDF), treat as **issue/missing** and request **evidence** (photo/screenshot/spec).
* If inputs are **blank/insufficient**, treat **all core particulars as missing**; do **not** assume compliance.
